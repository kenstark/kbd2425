Birthday website for Kim Dao


Description: Hosted on GitHub Pages
The homepage should just have one enter button, once you click enter then its gonna show "the best things about 24" and then it's gonna have a couple examples and then it's gonna go into the pictures and memories like one video and down below that its gonna be split 2 images per horizontal frame. I want it to be one page that you can scroll down
